It’s heavily inspired by `acts_as_follower`. However, it’s not 100% compatible with `acts_as_follower` as I removed some “features”:

* Block a follower
* Methods that returned mixed types of followers/following
* `*_count` methods (see the new features list)

But I also added awesome new ones:

* You can use `following_team_ids` but also `following_team_names` (basically any `following_team_<column>s`). It takes advantage of the `pluck` method, so it doesn’t create an instance of each follower, it just return the relevant column values. (Go check `pluck` documentation, it’s simply awesome).
* The `followers` and `followings` methods now return an `ActiveRecord::Relation` for easy chaining, scoping, counting, pagination, etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'partisan'
```

And then execute

```bash
$ bundle
```

Run the migration to add the `follows` table and the `Follow` model:

```bash
$ rails generate partisan:install
```

## Usage

Create a couple of models.

```ruby
class Fan < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_follower
end

class Band < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_followable
end
```

And follow/unfollow other records!

```ruby
fan = Fan.find(1)
band = Band.find(2)

fan.follow(band)
fan.following_bands
# => [<Band id=2>]

fan.follows?(band)
# => true

fan.unfollow(band)
fan.follows?(band)
# => false
```

### Cache counters

Most of the times, you would want to get a quick look at about how many fans follow a certain resource. That could be an expensive operation.

However, if the *followed* record has a `followers_count` column, Partisan will populate its value with how many followers the record has.

```ruby
fan.follow(band)

band.followers.count
# SQL query that counts records and returns `1`

band.followers_count
# Quick lookup into the column and returns `1`
```

The same concept applies to `followable` with a `followings_count` column.

### Callbacks

You can define callbacks that will be triggered before or after a following relationship is created.

If a `before_follow` callback returns `false`, it will halt the call and the relationship will be not be saved (much like `ActiveRecords`’s `before_save` callbacks).

```ruby
class Fan < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_follower
  after_follow :send_notification

  def send_notification
    puts "#{self} is now following #{self.just_followed}"
  end
end

class Band < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_followable
  before_follow :ensure_active_fan

  def ensure_active_fan
    self.about_to_be_followed_by.active?
  end
end
```

The available callbacks are:

#### Follower

| Callback          | Reference to the followable |
| ------------------|-----------------------------|
| `before_follow`   | `self.about_to_follow`      |
| `after_follow`    | `self.just_followed`        |
| `before_unfollow` | `self.about_to_unfollow`    |
| `after_unfollow`  | `self.just_unfollowed`      |

#### Followable

| Callback                  | Reference to the follower        |
| --------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `before_being_followed`   | `self.about_to_be_followed_by`   |
| `after_being_followed`    | `self.just_followed_by`          |
| `before_being_unfollowed` | `self.about_to_by_unfollowed_by` |
| `after_being_unfollowed`  | `self.just_unfollowed_by`        |
